# About me

Hi my name is Amiel Monasterial! I am an incoming sophomore CCIS student at Northeastern University, currently pursuing a BS in computer science. Before moving to Boston for college, I lived in Wethersfield, CT. It was in high school where I first discovered my affinity for building things. As a member, and later captain, of my school's Engineering Design Team, I helped in the creation of several pieces of assistive technology for use by a local nonprofit named CW Resources. After a small stint at a residential startup incubator at MIT during the summer of my junior year, I developed a major liking to computer science!
