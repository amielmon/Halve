# About me

Hi my name is Amiel Monasterial! I am an incoming sophomore CCIS student at Northeastern University, currently pursuing a BS in computer science. Before moving to Boston for college, I lived in Wethersfield, CT. It was in high school where I first discovered my affinity for building things. As a member, and later captain, of my school's Engineering Design Team, I helped in the creation of several pieces of assistive technology for use by a local nonprofit named CW Resources. After a small stint at a residential startup incubator at MIT during the summer of my junior year, I developed a major liking to computer programming and the rest is history!

Above, you can find my blog, as well as some of the projects that i've worked on. You can also check out my resume [here]({{ "/assets/resumedraft.pdf" | absolute_url }}). Other than software engineering, i'm also an avid home chef and am extremely interested in men's fashion. You can read more about these interests, including my recent clothing pickups and some of my favorite recipes (on top of different bits and bobs related to computer science), in my blog.
